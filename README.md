# YMax Portfolio UI

This is a user interface for testing the [YMax Portfolio Contract](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/blob/master/packages/portfolio-contract/). The YMax contract enables users to create and manage portfolios that deploy stablecoins across different yield-generating protocols. This UI provides a way to interact with the contract to test its functionality, such as creating portfolios, funding positions, and rebalancing across protocols like USDN, Aave, and Compound.

This application allows users to connect a wallet, view balances for various tokens, and make offers to the contract to manage their portfolio.

## Getting Started

To run the UI locally, first install the dependencies, then start the development server:

```sh
yarn install
yarn start:ui
```
